# Definition of Done (DoD) Checklists Repository

This repository serves as a central hub for storing and managing **Definition of Done (DoD)** checklists in JSON format. The goal is to provide a clear and consistent understanding of what "Done" means across different types of work items and their lifecycle stages.

---

## Contents

This repository contains a collection of JSON files. Each file defines one or more DoD checklists for ValueEdge ticket types, categorized by the type of work item.

Each JSON file follows this structure:

```json
{
  "Defect": {
    "categories": {
      "Reproduction": {
        "checklist": [
          "Steps to reproduce the issue are clearly documented",
          "Actual vs expected behavior is described",
          "Screenshots or logs are attached, if applicable"
        ],
        "phases": ["New", "In Progress"]
      },
      "Resolution": {
        "checklist": [
          "Root cause analysis is documented",
          "Solution has been tested and verified",
          "All relevant stakeholders are informed of the fix",
          "Test cases are updated to cover the issue"
        ],
        "phases": ["Done", "Resolved"]
      }
    }
  },
  "Spike": {
    "categories": {
      "Planning": {
        "checklist": [
          "Objective of the spike is clearly defined",
          "Expected deliverables are documented",
          "Team has agreed on a timebox for the spike"
        ],
        "phases": ["New", "In Progress"]
      },
      "Analysis": {
        "checklist": [
          "Relevant research and findings are documented",
          "Any discovered blockers or risks are noted",
          "Recommendations or next steps are provided"
        ],

      }
    }
  }
}

## Properties Explanation
Work Item Types
The root-level keys (e.g., "Defect", "Spike", "Story", "Epic") represent different types of work items.

### Categories
Logical groupings of related checklist items within a work item type. Categories help organize checklist items based on purpose or workflow stage.

### Checklist
An array of strings representing specific actions, validations, or requirements that must be completed for a given category.

### Phases
Workflow stages during which the checklist applies. This maps checklist categories to relevant stages in the itemâ€™s lifecycle.

We welcome contributions to expand and refine the collection of DoD checklists.
